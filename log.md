# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

**Link(s) to work**
1. [Find the Longest Word in a String](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/find-the-longest-word-in-a-string)
2. [Title Case a Sentence](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/title-case-a-sentence)

### Day 2: October 22, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: I'm picking this back up because I want to be good at the things I'm interested in. Also because I'm failing my course.

**Thoughts** 
1. problems with the last element and array bounds
2. corner cases (1 character input)

**Link(s) to work**
1. [Roman to Integer](./roman_to_integer.cpp)
